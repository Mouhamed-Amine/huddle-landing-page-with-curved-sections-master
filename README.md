## My process

### Built with

- TailWindCss
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework


### What I learned

I've struggled with Wavy section but I've missed setting the parent to relative which is essential to limit the absolute object to navigate within limited range

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I'm planning to Add Loading Screen along with few animation , Apply CI/CD automation on that .
